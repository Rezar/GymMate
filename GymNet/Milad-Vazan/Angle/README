We are trying to calculate angles at the joints to capture the movement and the distribution of the same in the different time frames.

There are eight angles we are calculating -
The angle between hip and ankle (Left and right)
The angle between shoulder and knee (Left and right)
The angle between elbow and hip (Left and right)
The angle between wrist and shoulder (Left and right)

The angle between two vectors(θ) = cos-1 [ (a · b) / (|a| |b|) ].

Function used - 

def dotproduct(v1, v2):
  return sum((a*b) for a, b in zip(v1, v2))

def length(v):
  return math.sqrt(dotproduct(v, v))

def angle(v1, v2):
  return math.acos(dotproduct(v1, v2) / (length(v1) * length(v2)))
